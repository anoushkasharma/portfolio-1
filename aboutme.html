  <h1>About Caity</h1>
 Â <p> Hi! My name is Caity Berry and I am a junior at Palo Alto High School. I was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and lived there for about 5 years. I then moved to Durham, North Carolina and I spent a bulk of my life living there until I moved to Palo Alto, California in 2014. I started learning how to code in the summer of 2017 through a Girls Who Code 7 week immersion program at Pivotal. After learning how to code, I coded this website myself using html. My whole life I have always loved mind games, mathematics and puzzles. I've always enjoyed logical delimias because it makes you think. I've grown to enjoying coding because it stimulates the part of my brain that likes a challenge and I love the feeling when I successfully code a website and am able to translate my thoughts into the Internet. </p>
